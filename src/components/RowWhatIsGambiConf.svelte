    <h4>What is GambiConf?</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="column content">
    <p>
      GambiConf is a unique tech conference that's gonna blow your mind! üêí
    </p>

    <p>
      It features projects and ideas that are definitely outside the box. Let's expand the boundaries of
      what's possible, unlocking unknown knowledge‚Äîjust like we did in the 2021 edition when we learned
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiXNTdmL2Q">how to build computers using only water</a>
      and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-o3ToBC0AI">how to run DOOM on an oscilloscope</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a multilingual, not limited to a specific technology, conference. We try to focus more on the
      purpose of the presented projects, the unique nature of the sessions, and what one can learn from a random,
      very unusual, idea. We want to encourage people to try new ideas and discover new things,
      for the simple sake of curiosity and exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based on conferences like <a href="https://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a> and <a href="http://sigbovik.org/">SIGBOVIK</a>,
      we organized the first edition of GambiConf last year in Brazil in Portuguese-speaking. Now, we want to bring
      the event to Portugal in English-speaking!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you've ever worked on a really hacky personal project or thought of a unique-underground-workaroundish way of doing something in CS,
      come share your experience! We want to hear from you!
