      <p>
        GambiConf is a unique tech conference that's gonna blow your mind! üêí
      </p>

      <p>
        It features projects and ideas that are definitely outside the box. Let's expand the boundaries of
        what's possible, unlocking unknown knowledge‚Äîjust like we did in the 2021 edition when we learned
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWiXNTdmL2Q">how to build computers using only water</a>
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-o3ToBC0AI">how to run DOOM on an oscilloscope</a>!
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a multilingual, not limited to a specific technology, conference. We try to focus more on the
        purpose of the presented projects, the unique nature of the sessions, and what one can learn from a random,
        very unusual, idea. We want to encourage people to try new ideas and discover new things,
        for the simple sake of curiosity and exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on conferences like <a href="https://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a> and <a href="http://sigbovik.org/">SIGBOVIK</a>,
        we organized the first edition of GambiConf last year in Brazil in Portuguese. Now, we want to bring
        the event to Portugal in English!
